		<br>
		<b>Max Rows to Display</b>
		<br><br>
		For queries that display their results on the screen, the maximum number of rows to return.
		For certain databases, not setting a maximum result limit can negatively impact performance.  This is because
		some databases require all rows to be retrieved for a query before the next query can be executed.  Setting
		a limit on the maximum number of rows that will be retrieved can greatly improve performance for these
		types of databases.
		<br><br>
		The Max Rows to Display setting only affects results that display on the screen.  Operations like Export and
		Backup are not affected by this setting.  To set a global maximum results limit for all operations, specify
		a value in the "Max Rows to Retrieve Per Query" field on the "Query Results" tab of the preferences window.
