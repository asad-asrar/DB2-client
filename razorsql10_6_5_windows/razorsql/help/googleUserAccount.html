		<b>Google User Account Authentication</b>
		<br><br>
		The Google User Account authentication option prompts the user to visit a Google API web page during the connection process
		to obtain an access token to be used to authenticate.
		<br><br>
		When using the Google User Account authentication option, after clicking connect, a dialog will appear with a URL to be
		entered into your web browser on your local machine.  Copy and paste the URL into the web browser, and then follow
		Google's prompts to obtain an access token.  Once you obtain the access token, copy and paste it back into the 
		dialog.  The BigQuery driver will then use the access token to authenticate the connection.
