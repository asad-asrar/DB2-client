		<b>AWS Credentials Manual Entry</b>
		<br><br>
		Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts are protected by access credentials such as
		an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key and in certain circumstances, a session key. These credentials can either
		be entered manually or retrieved from a file.  
		<br><br>
		If choosing to enter the credentials manually, RazorSQL needs at least the access key and secret key.  If using
		the AWS STS service to use temporary credentials to authenticate, RazorSQL also needs the session token.
