		<b>Google App Default Credential Authentication</b>
		<br><br>
		The Google App Default authentication option looks for a Google credentials file on the local machine.  To find the credentials file,
		the following environment variable must be set to the location of the Google credentials file:
		<br><br>
		GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
		<br><br>
		Note: If setting the environment variable for the first time, the local machine may need to be restarted for the environment
		variable to be viewable by applications such as RazorSQL.
