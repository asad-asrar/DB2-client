		Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts are protected by access credentials such as
		 an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key.  If using the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to obtain credentials to access
		 AWS resources, a session token may also be required to authenticate.
		 If not using STS, the Access Key and Secret Key should be the only fields required to authenticate.
		 If using STS, the Access Key, Secret Key, and Session Key would be required.
