		<b>AWS Credentials File</b>
		<br><br>
		Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts are protected by access credentials such as
		an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. These credentials can either
		be entered manually or retrieved from a file.  AWS provides a credentials file
		format that can be used to store the credentials.
		<br><br>
		Multiple different sets of credentials can be stored in the credentials file.  The sets
		are distinguished from one another by a profile name.
		<br><br>
		If electing to have RazorSQL use the AWS credentials file to authenticate against the AWS 
		service such as DynamoDB, SimpleDB, or Athena, RazorSQL needs the location of the credentials 
		file.  If there are multiple profiles configured in the credentials file, RazorSQL
		also needs the name of the profile to use to get the credentials.
