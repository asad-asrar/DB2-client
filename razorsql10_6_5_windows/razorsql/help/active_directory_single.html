		<b>Active Directory Single Sign-on / Integrated Authentication</b>
		<br><br>
		Checking this box causes RazorSQL to attempt to authenticate against Active Directory with the credentials of the current
		user logged in to the Windows machine.  This option is available for Windows only.  This option requires the installation
		of the adal.dll library (or adalsql.dll library for older machines) available from Microsoft.
		<br><br>
		The newer adal.dll library can be installed with the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver available
		at the following: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16
		<br><br>
		Please note that Microsoft no longer provides the older adalsql.dll library.
