		<b>Redshift Authentication with User and Password</b>
		<br><br>
		If selecting the Redshift User and Password authentication option, the user and password supplied should
		be a user and password defined for the Redshift database.  This is different than authenticating using AWS
		IAM credentials.  The user and password would be Redshift specific and not an IAM access and secret key.
