		RazorSQL supports two kinds of password files.  These are a RazorSQL password file that is simply a file
		containing nothing more than the password, and a pgpass formatted password file.  
		<br><br>
		The pgpass formatted file is a file format mostly used by PostgreSQL tools.
		
		<br><br>
		<b>Password File</b>
		<br><br>
		To connect using a password file, create a file containing nothing more than the password.  The file
			should not contain any extra line breaks or white space.  Select the "Password File" option in the
			Authentication Type drop-down to use a Password File.
		<br><br>
		<b>pgpass File</b>
		<br><br>
		The pgpass file format is a format used mostly by PostgreSQL tools, but RazorSQL allows the use
		of the pgpass format for other database types also.
		<br><br>
		The pgpass file uses the following format.  It can have one to many lines in the file for different hosts, ports, database names,
		and users:
		<br><br>
		hostname:port:database:username:password
		<br><br>
		Based on the host, port, database name, and login/user name the user enters in the RazorSQL add connection profile
		process, RazorSQL will search the pgpass password file to attempt to find a matching line.  RazorSQL will use the first
		matching line to read the password from the file.
		<br><br>
		Wildcard characters can be used to prevent matching based on certain fields.  The wildcard character is the *.
		For example, if * was entered for the hostname, the host provided to RazorSQL would be ignored in the matching logic.
		<br><br>
		Here are two example lines for a pgpass file.  The first line contains data for each field, the second line would only
		match based on host:
		<br><br>
		sample.acme.com:5432:sales:testuser:testpass
		<br><br>
		sample.acme.com:*:*:*:testpass
