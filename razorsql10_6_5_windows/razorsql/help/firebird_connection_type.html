		<b>Firebird Connection Type</b>
		<br><br>
		RazorSQL can connect to Firebird in two ways - either directly to a Firebird database file,
		or to a Firebird database file through a running Firebird server.
		<br><br>
		To connect directly to a file, select the Local File connection type option and enter
		the file location.
		<br><br>
		To connect via Firebird server, enter the host and port of the Firebird server
		and the Firebird file location.  Please note that the server needs to be able to
		access the file through the file system to be able to connect.
